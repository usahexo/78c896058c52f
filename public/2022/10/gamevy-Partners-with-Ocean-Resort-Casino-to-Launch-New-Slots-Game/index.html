<p>Atlantic City, NJ – June 26, 2018 – Gamevy, a leading supplier of innovative digital gambling games, announced today that it has partnered with Ocean Resort Casino to launch a new slots game. The game, called ‘Ocean’s Riches’, is now available at the casino both on desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>The new game is a five-reel slots game with 20 paylines. It features a wide range of bonus rounds and special features, including free spins, multipliers and bonus games. Players can also win up to $250,000 in the main game and up to $1 million in the bonus rounds.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with Ocean Resort Casino to launch our new slots game” said James Marshall, CEO of Gamevy. “The casino has a great reputation and we are sure that players will enjoy our new game.”</p>
<p>Ocean Resort Casino is one of the newest casinos in Atlantic City. It opened its doors in June of this year as the sister property to the nearby Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City. The casino offers over 1,500 slot machines and over 100 table games.</p>

This move is seen as a way to revitalize the property, which has been struggling since it opened in 2012.</p>
<p>“We are excited to bring Bally’s innovative gaming products to our guests,” said Don Marrandino, president of Ocean Resort Casino. “This partnership enables us to provide an even more engaging and exciting experience that will keep our players coming back.”</p>
<p>Bally’s products will include its popular Hot Shot progressive slots, as well as games like Cash Wizard and Michael Jackson King of Pop.
