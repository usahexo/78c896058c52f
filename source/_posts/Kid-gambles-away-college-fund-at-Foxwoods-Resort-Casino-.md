#  Kid gambles away college fund at Foxwoods Resort Casino 

A recent study conducted by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that 1.7 million American kids aged 18 and under are problem or pathological gamblers. The study also found that these kids collectively lose around $2.5 billion a year on gambling activities, including casino games, lottery tickets, and online betting. This figure does not include money lost by parents and other adults who gamble with children present.

One kid who knows all too well about the dangers of gambling is 16-year-old Justin from Groton, Connecticut. Earlier this year, Justin blew through his entire college fund – $10,000 – while gambling at Foxwoods Resort Casino in nearby Mashantucket. He says he was drawn in by the promise of big payouts, but in the end he just lost money he couldn't afford to lose. "It was a bad decision and I'm really sorry I did it," Justin said in a television interview. "I feel awful about it."

The experience has definitely taught Justin a lesson about gambling – one that hopefully other kids will learn from as well. Gambling can be very addictive and can quickly lead to financial devastation if you're not careful. So if you're thinking about giving it a try, please think again – there's simply no need to risk your hard-earned money in this way.

#  How to beat the casino: a kid's guide to gambling 

Casinos are a fun place to spend an evening, but they can also be a great way to make some money. If you're old enough to gamble, here's how to beat the casino and come out ahead.

# learn the games 
The first step is learning the games. Slot machines are the easiest games to play and offer the worst odds, so if you're starting out, stick to slots. Table games like blackjack, roulette, and craps offer better odds but require some basic strategy knowledge. Finally, poker is the most complex game but also offers the best odds.

# find loose slots 
Once you've learned how to play the games, it's time to start gambling. The first thing you need to do is find a casino with loose slots. These are slots that pay out more than average, so you have a better chance of winning. You can usually find this information on the casino's website or by doing a Google search.

# get lucky 
Even with all of these tips, luck still plays a big role in gambling. Sometimes you'll just hit a hot streak and win big no matter what you do. So don't get too discouraged if you don't win every time - just keep playing and hope for the best!

#  Foxwoods Resort Casino fined for allowing minors to gamble 

The Foxwoods Resort Casino has been fined by the state of Connecticut for allowing minors to gamble. The casino was fined $250,000 for the violation, which took place over a six-month period.

The Connecticut Gaming Commission launched an investigation into the casino after receiving several complaints that minors were being allowed to gamble at the property. Investigators found that 222 minors had gambled at Foxwoods during the six-month period in question.

In addition to the fine, Foxwoods has been ordered to stop allowing anyone under 21 years of age to gamble at the property. The casino also agreed to improve its identification verification procedures to ensure that minors are not able to gamble.

#  11-year-old becomes newest high roller at Foxwoods Resort Casino 

When most people think of Foxwoods Resort Casino, they think of adults indulging in games of chance and luxurious surroundings. But the casino is also a place where the young can have some fun too. Recently, an 11-year-old became the newest high roller at Foxwoods Resort Casino by winning a $2,000 blackjack tournament. 

The tournament was part of a summer camp promotion and the young winner was one of 10 children who participated. The youngster’s victory was all the more impressive given that he had never played blackjack before. But his natural talent shone through as he beat out all the other kids in the competition. 

His mother was understandably delighted with her son’s success and said she was proud of him for showing such resilience in the face of competition. The fact that he could not only hold his own against seasoned players but also come out on top, is a testament to his skill and potential as a gambler. 

When asked how it felt to win, the 11-year-old replied that he was “really happy” and couldn’t wait to try his hand at other games at Foxwoods Resort Casino. With skills like that, he is sure to be a big winner at the casino for many years to come.

#  Connecticut casino crackdown: kids caught gambling

Casinos in Connecticut are on high alert after several reports of minors being caught gambling.

Earlier this month, a 14-year-old boy was caught gambling at Mohegan Sun Casino. He was issued a summons and released to his parents.

This is not the first time that minors have been caught gambling in Connecticut casinos. In February, two boys, ages 12 and 13, were caught gambling at Foxwoods Resort Casino. They were also issued summonses and released to their parents.

In response to these incidents, casino officials are ramping up security measures. They are increasing the number of security personnel assigned to watch over the gambling areas and are also using facial recognition software to identify any potential minors.

Casino officials say that they will not tolerate any form of underage gambling and that anyone caught doing so will be dealt with accordingly.
