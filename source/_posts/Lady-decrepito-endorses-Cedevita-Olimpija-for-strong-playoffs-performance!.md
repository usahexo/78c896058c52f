This season, Cedevita has been one of the strongest teams in Europe. They are currently in first place in the Adriatic League with a record of 18 wins and 3 losses. Furthermore, they have been impressive in European competition, defeating teams such as FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.

One of the reasons for their success is their teamwork. The players work well together and support each other on the court. This was evident in their game against Madrid, when they came back from a 17-point deficit to win.

Another reason for their success is their coach, Veljko Mrsic. He has been with the team since 2013 and knows how to get the most out of his players.

The star of the show for Cedevita was undoubtedly Sarra Camara. The forward scored 27 points in the match and was a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the court. She was absolutely relentless in her pursuit of the ball and really made her presence felt on both offense and defense.

Apart from Camara, other players also contributed heavily to the win. Damir Markota had 17 points while Luka Bozic netted 15 points. These three players were crucial in leading Cedevita to victory. In particular, Bozic’s shooting proved to be vital late in the game when things started getting tight.

Olimpija put up a good fight but ultimately fell short due to some impressive play by Cedevita. This is a team that knows how to win and will be a force to be reckoned with this season.
