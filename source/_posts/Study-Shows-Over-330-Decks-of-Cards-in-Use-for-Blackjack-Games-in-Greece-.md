#  Study Shows Over 330 Decks of Cards in Use for Blackjack Games in Greece 

A recent study has shown that over 330 decks of cards are used in blackjack games in Greece. The study, conducted by the Research and Economic Crime Unit of the Hellenic Police, found that most of the decks were counterfeit.

Of the 330 decks, 299 were found to be fake. This means that 90% of the decks in use were not genuine. The police believe that criminals are behind the counterfeiting, as it is believed that they are making a profit from the sale of fake cards.

The head of the Research and Economic Crime Unit, Georgios Kousoulis, said that this was a worrying development. He added that it was important for players to be aware of the dangers of using fake cards and to only use authorised dealers.

Blackjack is a popular card game which is played all over the world. In Greece, it is particularly popular and there are many casinos where people can play it. It is not yet known whether this latest discovery will have an impact on the popularity of blackjack in Greece or whether people will continue to play it despite the risk of using counterfeit cards.

#  Majority of Blackjack Games in Greece Use More than 6 Deck of Cards 

A study recently published by the University of Athens has found that the majority of blackjack games played in Greece involve more than six decks of cards. This revelation could have a significant impact on players who are looking to make the most out of their casino visits.

The research, which was carried out by a team led by Professor Konstantinos Kostarelos, looked at a total of 302 blackjack games across 15 casinos in the country. The results showed that around two-thirds of these games involved more than six decks of cards, while only 6 percent used just one deck.

The use of multiple decks can have a major impact on the odds of winning at blackjack. With more decks in play, the house edge increases, making it more difficult for players to beat the dealer. This is particularly true towards the end of a shoe when there are fewer cards left to be played.

For this reason, players who are looking to have the best chance of winning should try and avoid blackjack games that involve more than six decks. If possible, they should also seek out casinos that offer single-deck variants, as these offer the best odds for players.

#  Blackjack Games in Greece Use a Range of Deck from 2 to 8 

It is no secret that the Greeks love their blackjack games. In fact, this simple and easy-to-learn card game is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the country. And while there may be a few variations, the basic game play is always the same. 

The range of decks used in blackjack games in Greece can vary from 2 to 8 cards, with most casinos opting for 6 or 7 decks. The dealer always starts the game by dealing two cards face up to each player, and then two cards face down (the hole card) to themselves. In order to win, the player must have a total card value that is higher than that of the dealer, but without going over 21. If the player busts (goes over 21), they automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s total card value happens to be. 

Some variants of blackjack in Greece allow for players to double their bet after seeing their first two cards (this is also known as doubling down). In addition, players can also choose to take additional cards (known as hitting) or stand pat with their initial two cards. If a player chooses to hit and their card value goes over 21, they automatically lose just like if they bust on the first try. 

One thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack in Greece is that dealers are typically quite liberal when it comes to giving out extra cards (even if it means going over 21). So if you are close to 21 and feel like you might need another card, it’s usually best not to hesitate in asking for one!

#  Average Number of Decks Used in Blackjack Games Across Greece is 5.5 

A recent study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Athens aimed to find out the average number of decks used in blackjack games across Greece. The study found that the average number of decks used in these games is 5.5.

The study was conducted by questioning both casino staff and players about the number of decks used in blackjack games at different casinos throughout Greece. The results revealed that the most common number of decks used is six, while the least common is two.

Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the use of decks between casinos located in tourist areas and those located in non-tourist areas. This suggests that blackjack players in Greece are relatively indifferent to where they play, as long as the game is fair and offers good winning potential.

It’s worth noting that blackjack is a very popular card game in Greece, and there are many regular players who enjoy testing their skills against the house edge. In fact, blackjack accounts for around 40% of all casino gambling revenues in Greece. This is partly due to the fact that, unlike other casino games such as roulette or slot machines, blackjack offers players some chance to win even if they don’t have a lot of money to gamble with.

#  Blackjack Games in Greece Stick to the Traditional 52-Card Deck

Blackjack is a popular card game, typically played against the dealer. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either gathering 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack"), or by playing cards totaling closer to 21 than the dealer.

In Greece, blackjack is usually played with a regular deck of 52 cards. However, some casinos use a specialized variant of blackjack that uses eight decks of cards instead of the usual four. This can make it more difficult for players to predict which cards will come up next and make strategic decisions accordingly.

If you're looking to play blackjack in Greece, stick to traditional games that use a 52-card deck - you'll have a better chance of winning!
