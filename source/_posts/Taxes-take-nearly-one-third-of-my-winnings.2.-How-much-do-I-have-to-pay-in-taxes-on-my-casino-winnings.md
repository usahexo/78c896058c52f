#  Taxes take nearly one-third of my winnings.2. How much do I have to pay in taxes on my casino winnings?

Casino winnings are considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Taxable income is all income you receive in a year, minus any deductions or exemptions you may qualify for.

3. The amount of tax you'll pay on your casino winnings depends on how much you won and your tax bracket.

For example, if you earn less than $37,950 per year (the 2018 tax year), you'll pay 10% of your casino winnings in taxes. If you earn more than $600,000 per year, you'll pay 37% of your casino winnings in taxes.4. There are also a few deductions and exemptions you may be able to claim to reduce the amount of tax you owe on your casino winnings.

For instance, if you paid state taxes on your casino winnings, those taxes can be deducted from your federal taxes. You may also be able to claim an exemption for gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings.5. Visit the IRS website for more information on how to report and pay taxes on your casino winnings.

Income from casinos and other gambling establishments are fully taxable in the United States, but there are a few ways to lower the tax bill. For starters, gamblers can deduct their losses up to the amount of their winningsâ€”a strategy that can nullify most or all of their taxable earnings from gambling activities.Gamblers can also take a standard deduction for gambling losses if they itemize their deductions come tax time; however, this only works if total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction amount available to that taxpayer. 

There are also state-specific rules when it comes to paying taxes on gambling income earned within state lines; some states have no specific rules at all while others exempt a certain amount of gambling income from taxation or have lower tax rates for gambling profits.It's important for gamblers to keep good records during the year so they have all the necessary documentation squared away when it comes time to file their returns.
