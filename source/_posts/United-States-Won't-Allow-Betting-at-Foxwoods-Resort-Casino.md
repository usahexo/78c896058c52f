#  United States Won't Allow Betting at Foxwoods Resort Casino

The United States Department of the Interior has announced that Foxwoods Resort Casino will not be allowed to offer sports betting. The announcement comes shortly after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting.

Foxwoods officials say they're disappointed by the decision, but they remain committed to providing an "exceptional gaming experience" for their customers.

The casino is the largest in the world, and it's expected that its sports betting operation would have been a major contributor to its bottom line.

It's not clear yet what this decision will mean for other casinos in Connecticut, which had been looking to Foxwoods as a model for how to set up their own sports betting operations.

#  Federal Government Closes Foxwoods Resort Casino for Gambling Violations

The Federal Government has closed the Foxwoods Resort Casino for a period of two years due to violations of gambling laws.

This is the first time that a casino in the United States has been closed for this reason.

Foxwoods, which is located in Mashantucket, Connecticut, has been open for more than 25 years.

The casino will be able to apply for a reopening after two years if it meets all the requirements set by the government.

Foxwoods has been fined $1.5 million for its violations.

#  Connecticut Police raid Foxwoods Resort Casino in search of illegal gambling activity

The Connecticut State Police raided Foxwoods Resort Casino this morning in search of illegal gambling activity.

This is the second such raid at Foxwoods in the past two months. In February, state police seized more than $30,000 from a gaming table at the casino.

Foxwoods officials said they are cooperating with the state police investigation.

"We have zero tolerance for any illegal gambling activity on our property," a Foxwoods spokesperson said in a statement. "We are fully cooperating with the Connecticut State Police and will take appropriate action against anyone found to be engaged in illegal gambling."

It's not clear what, if anything, state police found during this morning's raid. The investigation is ongoing.

#  No More Gambling at Foxwoods Resort Casino

If you've been looking for a reason to avoid Foxwoods Resort Casino, we have one for you: it's no longer gambling-friendly. That's right, the casino has made a recent change in policy and is now prohibiting anyone under the age of 21 from playing any of its games of chance.

This new rule is being put into place in response to the increasing popularity of online gambling among young people. In fact, studies show that as many as 1 in 5 children aged 11 to 16 have gambled online in some way. So, by keeping underage gamblers out of the casino, Foxwoods is hoping to help keep them safe.

While this may be disappointing news for those who were planning on visiting Foxwoods for some gambling fun, there are still plenty of other things to do at the resort. In addition to its world-class casino, Foxwoods boasts a luxury spa, several restaurants and bars, and a variety of shops. Plus, there's always the option of exploring the beautiful surrounding area.

So if you're looking for a fun (and now gambling-free) getaway, Foxwoods Resort Casino is definitely worth considering!

#  Foxwoods Resort Casino Closes Its Doors

Foxwoods Resort Casino, the largest casino in North America, announced on Wednesday that it would be closing its doors for good after failed attempts to negotiate a new contract with its union workers.

The closure of Foxwoods will leave more than 3,000 employees out of work and will have a devastating impact on the local economy. In addition to the jobs lost at the casino, an additional 5,000 jobs are expected to be eliminated from businesses that rely on Foxwoods for revenue.

This is not the first time that Foxwoods has faced financial difficulties. The casino filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was forced to lay off 1,500 employees. In 2017, Foxwoods was bought by the Mohegan Sun casino and efforts were made to revive the struggling business.

However, those efforts have now come to an end and the Mohegan Sun company has said that it plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy next week. This will be the second time in less than 10 years that the Mohegan Sun company has had to go through bankruptcy proceedings.
