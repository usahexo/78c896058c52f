#  How does Fresno Casino Blackjack Basic Strategy work?

The Fresno casino blackjack basic strategy is a betting system that is used to improve the odds of winning at blackjack. The strategy is based on a player’s first two cards and the dealer’s up card. The goal of the strategy is to reduce the house edge by increasing the player’s chances of winning without risking too much money.

The strategy begins by examining the player’s two cards and the dealer’s up card. If the dealer has a high card (ace or ten), then the player should hit. If the dealer has a low card (two through six), then the player should stand. If the dealer has a seven, eight, or nine, then the player can either hit or stand depending on their own hand.

If the player has an ace and a six, for example, they would hit if the dealer had an ace or ten upcard. If the dealer had a two or three upcard, however, they would stand.

It is important to remember that blackjack is a game of chance, so there is no guarantee that following this strategy will result in winning money.
