#  Ocean Resort Casino Welcomes New Gaming Provider

Ocean Resort Casino (formerly Revel) has announced a new partnership with slot manufacturer Bally Technologies, who will be supplying the casino with its latest gaming products. This move is seen as a way to revitalize the property, which has been struggling since it opened in 2012.

"We are excited to bring Bally's innovative gaming products to our guests," said Don Marrandino, president of Ocean Resort Casino. "This partnership enables us to provide an even more engaging and exciting experience that will keep our players coming back."

Bally's products will include its popular Hot Shot progressive slots, as well as games like Cash Wizard and Michael Jackson King of Pop. The casino will also be installing Bally's iVIEW display systems, which offer a variety of interactive features like bonus rounds, instant credit awards, and free spins.

"We are proud to partner with Ocean Resort Casino and support their efforts to revitalize the property," said Mike Trager, senior vice president of sales for Bally Technologies. "Our goal is to create an entertaining gaming experience that will appeal to both new and existing players."

The addition of Bally's games is expected to help turn around Ocean Resort Casino's fortunes. The casino has been dealing with financial difficulties since it opened in 2012, filing for bankruptcy twice in just three years. It was purchased by Bruce Deifik earlier this year, who has vowed to make it a success.
